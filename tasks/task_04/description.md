# Task 4 - Dam break problem (Riemann problem for shallow water equations)

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem Statement

Solve the shallow water equations for a dam break problem (Riemann problem) with initial conditions:

- $u_L = u_R = 0$ (velocity)
- $h_L = 0.1$ (left water height)
- $h_R = 1$ (right water height)

## Requirements

- Use finite volume method with Rusanov numerical flux
- Find numerical solution at time $t = 0.1$
