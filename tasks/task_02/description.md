# Task 2 - Initial value problem for nonlinear Burgers equation with periodic conditions

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem Statement

Solve the nonlinear Burgers equation:
$$u_t + \frac{1}{2}(u^2)_x = 0$$

on the interval $[0,2\pi]$ with periodic boundary conditions and initial condition $u(x,0) = \sin(x)$.

## Requirements

- Use any 1st order scheme
- Solve for time $t = 2$
- Use grid steps $h = 0.02$, $h = 0.01$, and $h = 0.005$
- Estimate error magnitude and order of accuracy from computed values
